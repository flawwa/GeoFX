This project, GeoFX, is a JavaFX-based application designed to retrieve and display geographic and network information about a given IP address using the Ipapi API. The core functionality revolves around the GeoService class, which leverages Retrofit to make HTTP requests to the Ipapi service. The user interface, implemented in the GeoController class, allows users to input an IP address and view detailed location, security, and network data. The project demonstrates effective use of asynchronous tasks to handle API responses, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience. Key visual elements include dynamic updates of geographic information and relevant icons.
